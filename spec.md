# Product Description

## Game Collection Management and Sourcing System

Board games (such as Pandemic, Wingspan, Space Base), , miniature war games (such as
Infinity, Age of Sigmar, Malifaux), card games (such as Magic the Gathering, Keyforge,
Pokemon) and role-playing games (such as ShadowRunner, Mutant Chronicles, Through the
Breach) have seen a huge rise in popularity over the last 20 years, once a minor interest, these
hobbies have become a large business area and a large social scene in the UK and beyond.
Companies and individuals across the world have begun to produce lots of games of different
themes and mechanics. Correspondingly there has been an increase in shops which sell or
specialise in games, magazines and websites which have content for these games and clubs
for players. Managing a personal collection can be difficult enough, and it can be difficult to
find players or new games. It can become quite daunting particularly when moving to a new
area.

There are some solutions for managing collections available, such as BoardGameGeek, but
these are limited in function or awkward to use. They rarely have a good way to manage
across game types particularly when there are expansions or multiple components to a game.
For example, managing a card collection is often hard in a system for mainly board games.
This leads to having multiple collection managers, meaning more overhead for the user,
meaning less games getting played.

The product has to allow a user to manage their game collection, across types, allowing them
to search, update and add/remove items to it. They should be able to search for games they do
not have, look at reviews for games both from a user community, websites and be able to add
their own reviews, a rating system should be enabled for games – this can have public and
private elements. This could include a weighting system or the ability to ignore certain review
sources.

The product should enable a way for users to share house rules for games, and clarifications
of rules for games – this includes pulling FAQs and errata documents from publishers. The
system should enable the suggestion of new games to users. This should use the reviews
submitted by a user, their collection and where they are for potential gaming communities.
The product should allow for searching for potential new players using the system to play
with, clubs in a given geographical search area.

The product should have a way to look at pricing for new and used game products and links
to sellers.
