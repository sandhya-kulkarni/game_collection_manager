## Steven Tuffin 

Hi all,

I’m Steve and work full time as a developer on a financial application in Edinburgh.

Have around 10 years experience in different technical roles, though mainly focus on the front end so have a fair understanding of user-centered design, accessibility, REST APIs and security.

As others have mentioned, careful planning of time is very important to me. My three year old is generally the boss when she’s awake, so would mainly be looking to study in the evenings after 8pm.

I am in my second year of the HPC with Data Science MSc - taking Programming Skills and Software Development this semester.

Look forward to working with you all.
