# Submission 1 : Requirements, Design and Team

Assessment involves discussion of [this product spec](spec.md); with the first submission containing:

* Requirements engineering
    * Functional requirements
	* Non-functional requirements
	* Capture methodology
	* Prioritisation
	
* Design of software:
	* architecture
	* component functionality	

* A user interface design for the prototype product, including an explanation of the reasoning behind your design, alternatives and a consideration of accessibility requirements.

* Team structure and role assignment

## Requirements Engineering (30 Marks)

This section should describe the methods of requirements capture used and any alternatives that would also have been possible, and appropriate, to use. 

These methods should include the source of any requirements and the broad profiles of any people involved. The analysis of the requirements should produce a set of prioritised functional and non-functional requirements for the prototype.

## Software Design (30 Marks)

These requirements should be used to create a design for the prototype. This design should indicate which features of the design satisfies which requirements. The design should include a technology breakdown, component and system design and implementation paths.

## User Interface Design (25 Marks)

This should be a user interface design, it does not need to be a functional product. It should have the control flow for the product, the user interaction detailed and the reasoning behind the design. This will include alternatives that have been considered.

The design should consider how it addresses accessibility criteria for users with different accessibility requirements.

## Team Structure and Role Assignment (15 Marks)

This section should contain the team structure that is employed in the assignment, including identified roles that the team members are assigned to and why. It should contain communication processes and how work is assigned to the team.

# Submission 2 :Development Plan

This submission should contain:
* Project	planning	including	major	task	breakdown	and	time/effort	estimates.
* Risk	analysis	including	risk	analysis	method	applied,	risks	identified	and	risk mitigation	strategies

## Planning and Scheduling
The planning section should contain the set of tasks required to complete the development of the prototype. This should incorporate the tasks required to complete the prototype and evaluation in the assessment. 
Each task should have a time effort estimate – where a task is complete it should have an actual time effort elapsed value. 
The tasks should include dependencies and team members assigned to each task.
This section should include task descriptions and a Gantt Chart.
This should include any changes to team structures or changes to design.

## Risk Analysis
This section should be a summary of risk analysis methods employed, risks identified and applied risk mitigation strategies. 
This forms the risk register for the project. These risks should have their impact on the project detailed, including general effects and specific task and component impacts.

# Submission 3 Code Prototype, Usability, Code and Project Evaluation

This submission should use the first submission content to complete the assignment.

This submission should contain:

* Code Prototype
    * The prototype for the	product, which should implement	your design	for	the	product	including user interface design (Submission	1).

* Usability	Test Plan
    * Usability	testing	planning, including	demographic	of test	cohort,	usability test procedure and results analysis plan.

* Usability	analysis
    * Using	the	results	of the planned usability test, the evaluation and conclusions should be	presented,	with changes and successes highlighted.

* Code and Project	Evaluation of the overall assignment:
    * An evaluation	of the state of	your prototype and a plan for what you would do	to further develop the prototype towards production	quality product.
    * A	project	evaluation, including a	discussion of your adherence to	your original plan.
      
## Product Prototype

A prototype should be developed according to the design and plan developed in submission
one.

This does not have to be a complete implementation - it is a prototype to demonstrate the
viability of the design and the core functionality identified by the design.
This prototype should be a functional code base which can be used as a basis for further
product development.

## Usability Test Plan

This section should contain a detailed plan for carrying out usability testing on the planned
user interface of your prototype. This should include the size and demographic of your test
cohort (age, gender, education to name a few) and the usability testing procedures that you
would follow.

It should include how you will analyse the results of the testing, including any statistical
methods you will use on quantitative data and how any qualitative data will be handled.
Usability Analysis

This should contain the results of the usability evaluation. This should include a description of
the usability tests you performed. It should also include a description of any deviations from
both your proposed plan and user cohort and demographics which occurred when you actually
carried out your tests. You should present your results and conclusions reached and the
impact of these results on the design of the prototype’s user interface.

## Prototype and Project Evaluation

The evaluation should be a critical appraisal of the current prototype against the original
design criteria set out in submission one. This should include if the design had to be altered,
replaced or was suitable and the associated reasoning.

This prototype evaluation should include an outline plan for taking the prototype or
components of it forward towards a production quality product.

The evaluation should include how your original planning matched with what actually
occurred. Were the time estimates correct? Were the tasks appropriate? How did the team
function against the original plan?
