# Submission 1 : Requirements, Design and Team

Assessment involves discussion of [this product spec](spec.md); with the first submission containing:

* Requirements engineering
    * Functional requirements
	* Non-functional requirements
	* Capture methodology
	* Prioritisation
	
* Design of software:
	* architecture
	* component functionality	

* A user interface design for the prototype product, including an explanation of the reasoning behind your design, alternatives and a consideration of accessibility requirements.

* Team structure and role assignment

## Requirements Engineering (30 Marks)

This section should describe the methods of requirements capture used and any alternatives that would also have been possible, and appropriate, to use. 

These methods should include the source of any requirements and the broad profiles of any people involved. The analysis of the requirements should produce a set of prioritised functional and non-functional requirements for the prototype.

## Software Design (30 Marks)

These requirements should be used to create a design for the prototype. This design should indicate which features of the design satisfies which requirements. The design should include a technology breakdown, component and system design and implementation paths.

## User Interface Design (25 Marks)

This should be a user interface design, it does not need to be a functional product. It should have the control flow for the product, the user interaction detailed and the reasoning behind the design. This will include alternatives that have been considered.

The design should consider how it addresses accessibility criteria for users with different accessibility requirements.

## Team Structure and Role Assignment (15 Marks)

This section should contain the team structure that is employed in the assignment, including identified roles that the team members are assigned to and why. It should contain communication processes and how work is assigned to the team.

# Submission 2 :Development Plan

This submission should contain:
* Project	planning	including	major	task	breakdown	and	time/effort	estimates.
* Risk	analysis	including	risk	analysis	method	applied,	risks	identified	and	risk mitigation	strategies

## Planning and Scheduling
The planning section should contain the set of tasks required to complete the development of the prototype. This should incorporate the tasks required to complete the prototype and evaluation in the assessment. 
Each task should have a time effort estimate â€“ where a task is complete it should have an actual time effort elapsed value. 
The tasks should include dependencies and team members assigned to each task.
This section should include task descriptions and a Gantt Chart.
This should include any changes to team structures or changes to design.

## Risk Analysis
This section should be a summary of risk analysis methods employed, risks identified and applied risk mitigation strategies. 
This forms the risk register for the project. These risks should have their impact on the project detailed, including general effects and specific task and component impacts.
